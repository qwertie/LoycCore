------------------

### v2.9.0.3 (a.k.a. v29): January 13, 2021 ###

#### Potentially breaking changes & deprecations: ####

**Loyc.Interfaces:**
- The `ListChanging` event in `INotifyListChanging<T>` and in all classes derived from `AListBase` was changed to use the new type `event ListChangingHandler<T, IListSource<T>> ListChanging`.
- Renamed `AddIfNotPresent<K, V>(this IDictionaryEx<K, V> dict, K key, V value)` to `TryAdd`, to match standard .NET methods such as `ConcurrentDictionary.TryAdd`. The old method is still there, but marked Obsolete.
- Added `ListChangingHandler<T, TSender>`, and deprecated `ListChangingHandler<T>` in favor of `ListChangingHandler<T, IListSource<T>>`. This change helps dictionaries, sets and other non-list collections to provide change notifications (i.e. `DictionaryWithChangeEvents` and `CollectionWithChangeEvents`).
- Added interfaces `ILast`, `IMLast`, `IFirst`, `IMFirst` for immutable and mutable `First` and `Last` properties of collections.
    - `IDeque` inherits from these instead of having First/Last properties;
    - `IFRange` now inherits from `IHasFirst`;
    - `IBRange` now inherits from `IHasLast`;
    - `IMFRange` now inherits from `IHasMFirst`;
- Added `IIndexedSink<in K, in V>` interface as base interface of `IDictionarySink<in K, in V>`
- Altered `ISourceRange` to use `IIndexRange` as its base interface
- Added `ISource<T>` as a new base interface of `IListSource<T>`. Because of this, all implementations of `IListSource<T>` now require an `IsEmpty` property.
- Added `IListAndListSource` and `ICollectionImpl` as base interfaces of `IListImpl<T>`
- Renamed `IHasXxx` interfaces to `IXxx`. Rationale: in v28 there were several interfaces like `IContains`,
`ICount`, `IPush`, `IOptimize` and `IIsEmpty` that are simply named after the method or property they contain. There were also several interfaces with an `IHas` pattern, e.g. `IHasValue`, `IHasLocation`, `IHasFileName`. I've decided it's better to have a regular naming scheme, and I simply tend to like the bare names (without 'Has') better.
    - Renamed `IHasLocation` to `ILocation` (old name is derived and marked obsolete)
    - Renamed `IHasValue` to `IValue (old name is derived and marked obsolete)
    - Renamed `IHasMutableValue` to `IMValue` (old name is derived and marked obsolete)
    - Renamed `IHasFileName` to `IFileName` (old name is derived and marked obsolete)
- Added `IDictionarySource<K,V>` as a new base interface of `IDictionaryImpl<K,V>`. Because of this, all implementations of this interface and `IDictionaryEx<K,V>` must now provide an `IsEmpty` property and a `TryGet` method in addition to `TryGetValue`. `TryGet` is better than `TryGetValue` because it supports variance, e.g. `ITryGet<object, Symbol>` can be assigned to a variable of type `ITryGet<string, object>`.
- Added new `ILineToIndex` interface as base interface of `IIndexPositionMapper`
- Make appending `UString` to `StringBuilder` more discoverable by making non-static `AppendTo` method (it cannot be an `Append` extension method on `StringBuilder` because `StringBuilder.Append(object)` takes priority.) The old static method `Append` is marked Obsolete.
- Added `ISparseListSource<T>.Slice()` method that must return `ISparseListSource<T>`
- Simplified `IListSource<T>.Slice` return value from `IRange<T>` to `IListSource<T>`. Experience has shown that Ranges don't work as well in C# as they do in D, and changing the return value to `IListSource` required no changes to any of the consumers of the lists in this codebase. Later I might remove implementations of `IRange<T>` from the Slice classes, but not yet.

**Loyc.Essentials:**
- `EmptyList<T>` is now a singleton and `EmptyList<T>.Value` is assigned to `new Repeated<T>(default(T), 0)` so that the rest of `EmptyList<T>` could be deleted.

**Loyc.Collections:**
- Renamed `AddIfNotPresent` methods in `BDictionary<,>` to `TryAdd`, to match standard .NET methods such as `ConcurrentDictionary.TryAdd`. The old methods are still there, but marked Obsolete.

**Loyc.Syntax:**
- Changes in `Token`:
    - `Token.ToStringStrategy` and `Token.SetToStringStrategy` now use `Func<Token, ICharSource, string>` instead of `Func<Token, string>` to allow the original token text to be obtained from source code.
    - `Token.ToLNode` was moved to `TokenTree` (the only class that uses this method) as `TokenTree.TokenToLNode(Token, ISourceFile)`. The old method still exists but is marked Obsolete.
    - Disabled the setter of the `Value` property. `WithValue` can be called to create a new token with a different value.
- Changes to support new literal system in LES2 and LES3 ([video on Loyc Literal System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttLc9iuxEro)):
    - Marked `CustomLiteral` as [Obsolete]
    - Added `ILNodePrinterOptions.LiteralPrinter` property of type `ILiteralPrinter` so users can more fully control the printing of literals
    - Rename `ISerializedLiteral` to `IUninterpretedLiteral`. The old name still exists and is marked [Obsolete].
    - `LNode.Equals` now includes `TypeMarker` in comparisons between string literals.
    - LES2 and 3 now recognizes fewer type markers than the previous version: markers using capital letters `_U`, `_UL`, `_F`, `_D` and `_Z` are no longer recognized. Such literals will still be included in the Loyc tree and no errors will be reported, but they are left uninterpreted.
- Renamed `LNodeFactory.List()` methods to `AltList()`. This is done to match the name used in `CodeSymbols` and to avoid confusion, since `List` does not create a JavaScript-style list (the symbol `CodeSymbols.Array` is assigned to that purpose.) The old name still exists and is marked `Obsolete`, but will be removed in the future.
- `NodeStyle`: increase `BaseStyleMask` from 3 to 4 bits and deprecate `OneLiner`
- Renamed `PrinterState` to `LNodePrinterHelper`, which implements the new interfaces `ILNodePrinterHelperWithRevokableNewlines<LNodePrinterOutputLocation, LNodePrinterHelper>` and `ILNodePrinterHelper`. The old name still exists (as a derived class) and is marked Obsolete.
- `LNodePrinterHelper.CommitNewlines` returns `this` instead of `int`.
- Class `DefaultNodePrinterWriter` has been deleted, as EC# and LES now use `LNodePrinterHelper` instead.
- Removed `Les2Printer.Writer` property and renamed `ParsedValue` to `LiteralFromParser` - changes that probably affect no one.

LES2:
- LES2 no longer prints TokenTree with its native syntax `@{...}`, as nothing important relied on this feature, it was lost in the refactor, and it never worked quite right anyway.
- `Les2Lexer.UnescapeString` and `UnescapeQuotedString` were moved to
  `Les3Lexer` (the old name still exists and is marked [Obsolete])
- `-123` is no longer a negative number. As in LES3, `-123` is a number with a `'-` operator attached to it, and you can force it to be interpreted as a negative literal using either the \u2212 minus sign (`âˆ’123`) or string syntax (`_"-123"`). The old interpretation was removed because it could cause unintuitive parsing, e.g.
  `-2**x` used to mean `(-2)**x` whereas `-a**x` means `-(a**x)`.

#### Non-breaking changes

#### Loyc.Interfaces

- Added `ILiteralParser` and `ILiteralPrinter` interfaces, which are implemented by `LiteralHandlerTable` in Loyc.Syntax.
- Added interfaces for observable collections:
    - `INotifyListChanged<T, TCollection>` which encapsulates a `ListChanged` event
    - `INotifyListChanged<T>` which acts as an alias for `INotifyListChanged<T, IListSource<T>>`
    - `IListWithChangeEvents<T>`, which combines `IListAndListSource<T>` with `INotifyListChanging<T>` and `INotifyListChanged<T>`
    - `IListExWithChangeEvents<T>`, which combines `IListEx<T>` with   `IListWithChangeEvents<T>` 
    - `IDictionaryWithChangeEvents<K, V>` (which combines `IDictionaryAndReadOnly<K, V>` with `INotifyListChanging<KeyValuePair<K, V>, IDictionary<K, V>>` and  `INotifyListChanged<KeyValuePair<K, V>, IDictionary<K, V>>`)
    - `IDictionaryExWithChangeEvents<K, V>` (which combines `IDictionaryEx<K, V>` with `IDictionaryWithChangeEvents<K, V>`).
- Brought back the `ISource<T>` interface, which is the same as `IReadOnlyCollection<T>` except that it implements `ICount` and `IIsEmpty`.
- Added `TryPopFirst()` and `TryPopLast()` methods in `UString`
- Added `ListChangeInfo<T>.OldItems` property. Also added support for this property to the ALists (classes derived from `AListBase<T>`)
- Added `IIndexRange` interface (with integer properties `StartIndex`, `EndIndex` and `Length`), and a simple implementation in `struct IndexRange` (with methods `Overlaps`, `Contains` and `GetRangeOfOverlap`).
- Added `IMIndexed<K,V>` (mutable derived interface of `IIndexed<K,V>`)
- Added `IDictionarySource<K,V>`, which is `IReadOnlyDictionary<K,V>` plus minor interfaces `IIndexed<K, V>`, `ITryGet<K, V>`, and `ISource<KeyValuePair<K, V>>`.
- Add `ILogMessage` interface that `LogMessage` implements
- Added static `MessageSink.Write(this IMessageSink<object>, ILogMessage)` and `MessageSink.Write(this IMessageSink<object>, LogMessage)` methods
- Added overload of `G.With` extension method that allows the lambda to take its value by reference
- Added methods to `CheckParam`: `ThrowBadArgument` (3 overloads), plus two new overloads of `ThrowOutOfRange`, and `ThrowIfStartOrCountAreBelowZeroAndLimitCountIfNecessary` (which encapsulates a common code sequence from many slice classes.)
- Added methods `Equals`, `GetHashCode`, and `ToString` in `Either<,>`
- `EmptySourceFile.Synthetic.FileName` is now "<Synthetic Code>" instead of "Synthetic", and `EmptySourceFile.Unknown.FileName` is "<Unknown Location>" instead of "Unknown".
- Workaround: added numerous overloads of the `.TryGet(key)` and `.TryGet(key, defaultValue)` extension methods for various interfaces and types derived from `ITryGet{K,V}` because C# is "unable to infer" the type parameters of `ITryGet{K,V}` itself.

#### Loyc.Essentials:

- Added wrapper classes with change events: `ListWithChangeEvents`, `DictionaryWithChangeEvents`, and `CollectionWithChangeEvents`. These classes provide change notifications for changes to ordinary non-observable collections.
- Added wrapper classes in Loyc.Essentials: `CollectionWrapper`, `ListWrapper`, `DictionaryWrapper`, and `SetWrapper`
- Added `AsSink` extension methods with helper classes `CollectionAsSink`, `DictionaryAsSink` and `ListAsSink`
- Added `NullMessageSink.Write(Severity)` overload and fixed the `Count` and `ErrorCount` properties, whose values were the reverse of each other.
- Added new overloads of `WithoutPrefix` and `WithoutSuffix` for `UString` in `StringExt`
    - Added `StringComparison` parameter for the existing extension methods for `string`
- Added extension method overload `AsListSource(this IReadOnlyList<T>)` with corresponding adapter class `ReadOnlyListAsListSource<T>`, plus 3 disambiguating overloads and a no-op (`AsListSource<T>(this IListSource<T> c) => c`)
- Added `BufferedSequence<T>.BufferedCount` property
- Added disambiguating overload `DictionaryExt.TryGetValue(this IDictionaryAndReadOnly...)`
- Added `SparseListSourceSlice` which can be used to implement the new `Slice` method in `ISparseListSource<T>` (and _is_ used by `SparseAList<T>`).
- Bug fix: when `Assert.AreEqual` failed, it sometimes showed `...` inappropriately at the end of the shorter of two strings when it did not truncate that string.

#### Loyc.Collections:

- `BMultiMap<,>.ValueList`: Added `IsEmpty`, `StartIndex`, `EndIndex` properties

#### Loyc.Syntax:

- Add general-purpose classes called `LiteralHandlerTable` and `StandardLiteralHandlers` for literal parsing and printing. Also, I made a [video about these classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttLc9iuxEro).
- Added `LNodeRangeMapper` class, the importance of which is explained by [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ue3W52iVH8c)
- Other changes to [`Token`](http://ecsharp.net/doc/code/structLoyc_1_1Syntax_1_1Lexing_1_1Token.html):
    - Added `TextValue` method, `TypeMarker` property, and corresponding constructors that make them work. Tokens that support this method are called "uninterpreted literals" and their `Value` is always null. Documentation of the new constructors explains how they work.
    - On 32-bit platforms this increases Token size from 16 to 20 bytes.
    - On 64-bit platforms the Token size is unchanged at 24 bytes.
    - `Token.Length` is now 32 bits instead of 24 (though `LNode.Range.Length` is still limited to 0x7FFFFF).
    - New overload `Token.ToString(ICharSource)` allows you to provide original source code to be used to figure out the string form of the Token.
    - Deprecated apparently unused method `Token.GetParenPairSymbol`
    - `Token` converts implicitly to `IndexRange`
- Other changes were made to support new literal system in LES2 and LES3:
    - `Les2Lexer` and `Les3Lexer` no longer parse literals (it's the parser's job now)
    - In `LNodeFactory`, `Literal(Token)` now automatically parses uninterpreted literals via `StandardLiteralHandlers.Value`. Added `LiteralFromValueOf(Token)` which replicates the old behavior of `Literal(Token)`, and `UninterpretedLiteral(Token)` which creates a literal node from an uninterpreted token without parsing the token (this used to be known as a "custom literal"). All the parser has to do to parse literals correctly now is to set `LNodeFactory.ErrorSink` so that it can report literal parsing errors.
    - `LNode.Equals` now includes `TypeMarker` in comparisons between string literals. The `TextValue`s are also compared when using `CompareMode.Styles`. By default, two literals are considered equal if their Values are equal and either (1) the TypeMarkers are equal, (2) the Values are not strings (nor UString)s, or (3) the Values are strings, but one of the type markers is null and the other is empty (zero-length `Name`). If `Equals` is called with the new `CompareMode.TypeMarkers` flag, strict equality of TypeMarkers is required.
    - LES2 and 3 printers now rely on `StandardLiteralHandlers`, but this requires them to use a more complex process to detect whether a number has valid syntax, because printers no longer know in advance which types will produce valid numeric strings. Instead, a new `CanPrintAsNumber` function is used to scan supposedly-numeric printed strings to find out if it's practical to print them as numbers.
- Changes to `LNodeFactory`:
    - Added no-arg `LNodeFactory()` constructor, which uses `EmptySourceFile.Unknown` as its implicit source file
    - Added optional `NodeStyle style = NodeStyle.Default` argument on several overloads of `Call`.
    - Added five new series of methods: `CallPrefix` (4 overloads), `CallPrefixOp` (6 overloads), `CallInfixOp` (4 overloads), `CallSuffixOp` (2 overloads), `CallBrackets` (not overloaded). These methods make it easier to create Loyc nodes that have correct values for the `Range` property by choosing an appropriate range for the requested kind of operator or call.
        - Use `CallPrefix` for ordinary calls with argument lists, e.g. `Method(x, y)`
        - Use `CallPrefixOp` for prefix operators and calls that start with an identifying token and end with a child node, e.g. `-x` or `from x in y`
        - Use `CallInfixOp` for binary and ternary infix operators, e.g. `x + y` or `c ? a : b`
        - Use `CallSuffixOp` for suffix operators, e.g. `x++`
        - Use `CallBrackets` for lists delimited by outer tokens, e.g. `{ x; y; }` or `(x, y)`
    - Added a new overload of `Dot` and `Braces` that are used similarly to the new methods above
    - As mentioned earlier, `Literal(Token)` behaves differently and methods `LiteralFromValueOf(Token)` and `UninterpretedLiteral(Token)` were added.
    - `LNodeFactory` now avoids returning nodes with invalid `endIndex`
    - Bug fix: `InParens` created a node with an incorrect value for `Range.EndIndex`
- Changes to trivia injectors:
    - `AbstractTriviaInjector` no longer uses `OneLiner`. Instead it scans into syntax trees recursively even if they are on a single line, giving the derived class an opportunity to inject `%appendStatement` trivia. While `OneLiner` was an interesting optimization, it caused problems in practice when interacting with macros, and therefore several macros had code to strip out the `OneLiner` style from their output. By not using `OneLiner`, this will no longer be necessary. Support for `OneLiner` has also been stripped out of Enhanced C#, LES2 and LES3.
    - Renamed `AbstractTriviaInjector.GetAttachedTrivia` to `GetTriviaToAttach` to be less confusing
    - Tweaked `AbstractTriviaInjector` to better handle "reified" newlines, i.e. newlines that are represented as identifiers like `'\n`. Given a stream of identifiers like { Ann, `'\n`, Bob } where `'\n` is also a newline in the trivia stream, the trivia injector used to produce
            Ann, @`%appendStatement` @(`%trailing`(`%newline`)) `'\n`, @`%appendStatement` Bob
        but now it will produce
            Ann, @`%appendStatement` `'\n`, Bob
    - If there are two blank lines between nodes `A\n\nB`, `AbstractTriviaInjector` now associates both newlines with `B`, so that ``(A; @`%newline` @`%newline` B)`` is emitted instead of ``(@`%trailing`(`%newline`) A; @`%newline` B)``. Its behavior has not changed for the case of three or more newlines (`A\n\n\nB` becomes ``(@`%trailing`(`%newline`, `%newline`) A; @`%newline` B)`` or a single newline (`A\nB` becomes ``(A; @`%newline` B)``). I decided that this behavior was more desirable in most cases. Unit tests of LES2, LES3 and EC# were changed to expect the new behavior.
- Changes to `IMacroContext` (with implementation in LeMP):
    - Added `ICollection<Symbol> OpenMacroNamespaces` property
    - Add `PreviousSiblings` and `AncestorsAndPreviousSiblings` properties to `IMacroContext`
    - Return type of `Ancestors` was expanded from `IReadOnlyList<LNode>` to `IListSource<LNode>` (this allows more `LinqToLists` methods to work on it. Arguably the right solution is to write more `LinqToLists` methods, but I took the easy way out.)
- Added interfaces `IPrinterHelper<out Self>` `ILNodePrinterHelper<out Self>`, `ILNodePrinterHelperWithRevokableNewlines<Checkpoint, out Self>` and `ILNodePrinterHelper`, plus extension methods in `LNodePrinterHelperExt`, and an extensible enum called `PrinterIndentHint`.
- Added overload `LNode.WithArgs(IEnumerable<LNode> args)`
- Added `LNodeList.AddIfNotNull(item)` method
- Added `ILNodePrinterOptions.SaveRange` property with support in EC#, LES2 and LES3 (in addition to `LiteralPrinter` property mentioned earlier)
- `BaseParserForList<,>` and `BaseParserForList<,,>` have new constructors that accept a `Func<Token,Token> getEofToken` instead of `Func<Token,Token> eofToken`. This allows an EOF token to be computed based on the second-to-last token, which is useful in streaming parsers that do not want to compute the correct EOF token up front. Previously, LES2 and LES3 used EOF tokens with `StartIndex=0` which is wrong; in error conditions (early EOF), this could cause an incorrect range to be associated with nodes that contain syntax errors. Updated LES2, LES3, and LLLPG parsers to use the new constructor (the EC# parser doesn't use BaseParserForList).
- Added static `SourceRange.New<IndexRange>(ISourceFile, IndexRange)` which returns `new SourceRange(source, range.StartIndex, range.Length)`, plus an implicit conversion from `SourceRange` to `IndexRange`.
- Bug fix in `LexerSource.Error(int, string, ...)`
- Bug fix in `BaseLexer`: if an error occurred at a certain position P, and then the lexer was Reset, and then another error occurred at P in the new file, the latter error would not be reported.

**LES2:**

- Custom literals now work in LES2 using basically the same syntax as LES3, e.g. `123myNumber` or `myString"hello"`. As in LES3, `StandardLiteralHandlers.Value` is being used to parse and print.
- Added `?>` and `<?` operators with same precedence as `?` and `:`
- Bug fix: LES2 printer used LES3 precedence for operators that start with `'`

**LES3:**

- LES3 parser now allows you to exit token list mode with a single quote, or begin token list mode after a comma. For example, `(' a b c ' Foo(2), ' d e f)` means `(a, b, c, Foo(2), 1, 2, 3)`.
- Added `?>` and `<?` operators with same precedence as `?` and `:`
- When using `ParsingMode.Expressions`, the LES parser no longer expects a newline between items and will not insert `%appendStatement` trivia when the expected newline isn't there
- Refined LES3 logic for detecting "unexpected separator" errors; doing it correctly is difficult. Previously `{ a, b\n }` and `{ a, b\n c }` would be treated as errors because the newline was treated like a semicolon; now, the first case is OK and the second case is still an error.
- Bug fix: `TokenType.Unknown` mistakenly had the same value as `TokenType.EOF` which could mess up error messages and cause LES3 parsing to stop instantly at an invalid token, such as a backslash.
- Bug fix: `}` was indented too much if there was a `//` comment on the previous line.
- Flipped inheritance relationship between `Les2PrecedenceMap` and `Les3PrecedenceMap`.

### v2.8.3: November 16, 2020 ###

Loyc.Interfaces:
- Bug fix: `default(UString).ToString()` no longer throws `NullReferenceException`

Loyc.Essentials:
- Add `G.WordWrap` functions, which break a paragraph into lines using a simple word-wrapping algorithm. There are two overloads, one of which supports variable-width characters. Also added a default character categorization strategy `G.GetWordWrapCharType`

Loyc.Math:
- Bug fix: `ComputeConvexHull` returned nothing if the input was a single point; it now returns that point.

Loyc.Syntax:
- Add `<>` operator to LES (#87)
- Added `LNodeExt` extension methods: `LNode.Unsplice`, `LNodeList.IncludingAttributes`, `LNode.IncludingTriviaFrom`. In macros, `IncludingTriviaFrom` should be used to copy comments and newlines from the original macro call to the output code.

### v2.8.2: July 24, 2020 ###

Loyc.Syntax:
- Add `ParsingOptions` class to implement `IParsingOptions` (it was unintentionally `internal` in the previous release)
- `LNodeList.AddRange` now accepts `IReadOnlyList<>`. It unintentionally accepted `IList<>` in the previous release.

### v2.8.1: July 6, 2020 ###

Loyc.Essentials:
- Add `G.Do<T, R>(this T obj, Func<T, R> action)` extension method for running a statement or block of statements inside an expression.
- Add `string` extension methods `WithoutPrefix` and `WithoutSuffix` for trimming off a specific prefix or suffix (if found) from a string.

Loyc.Collections:
- The `SmartSelectMany` methods of `FWList`, `VList`, `WList` now accept `IReadOnlyList<>` instead of `IList<>` in order to enable   new APIs in `LNode`. Technically these changes are breaking but in practice, VLists have few users so breakage should be minimal, and the change seems justifiable since most collections implement both interfaces (IList and IReadOnlyList) and `LNode` is the main user of
  `VList`.
- The `AddRange` and `InsertRange` methods in `FWList`, `VList`, and `WList` now accept `IReadOnlyList<>` instead of `IList<>`, as a
  necessary side effect of the change to `SmartSelectMany`.

Loyc.Syntax:
- Added new `SelectMany` and `RecursiveReplace` methods in `LNode`. There are now confusingly similar methods `RecursiveReplace` and this `ReplaceRecursive`. The reason for this confusing situation is that if the old method and the new method have the same name, the lambda you pass to it may be ambiguous between the two methods and cause a compiler error, so the names need to be different somehow to avoid this annoyance.
- `LNodeList.InsertRange` and `LNodeList.AddRange` now accept `IReadOnlyList<>` instead of `IList<>`.

### v2.8.0: July 3, 2020 ###

#### Potentially breaking changes:

General:
- .NET 3.5 and .NET 4 versions have been dropped, leaving .NET 4.5 and .NET Standard versions.

Loyc.Interfaces:
- Introduce `IIndexed<K,V>` and include it as a base interface of `IListSource<T>` and `IDictionaryAndReadOnly<K,V>`. It is also included indirectly in `IDictionaryEx<,>` and `IDictionaryImpl<,>`.
- Add `ITryGet<in K, out V>` and use it all over
    - `IListSource<T>` now implements `ITryGet<int, T>, IIndexed<int, T>`. This may break existing explicit interface implementations.
    - `INegListSource<T>` now implements `ITryGet<int, T>, IIndexed<int, T>` This may break existing explicit interface implementations.
    - `IDictionaryEx<K,V>` now implements `ITryGet<K,V>` (and its base interface `IDictionaryAndReadOnly<K,V>` implements `IIndexed<K,V>`). This may break existing implementations.
- Change `IIndexToLine`, `IIndexPositionMapper`, and `ILNode` to use new interfaces `IHasFileName`, `ISourceRange`, `ILineAndColumn`, and `ILineColumnFile`
    - This allowed `SourceRange` to be moved from Loyc.Interfaces back to Loyc.Syntax
    - This change also breaks implementors of `ISourceFile`

Loyc.Essentials:
- Move disambiguating `TryGet<T>(this IListAndListSource<T> list...)` extension methods to `MutableListExtensionMethods` namespace

Loyc.Syntax:
- Introduced `LNodeList` to replace `VList<LNode>` ([#100](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/100)) with automatic implicit conversions between the old and new collection types to minimize breakage. `LNodeList` is currently a wrapper around `VList<LNode>`, but the implementation could (of course) change later.
- Rename `CodeSymbols.PtrArrow` to `RightArrow` (old name marked Obsolete)
- Rename `CodeSymbols._RightArrow` to `RightArrow` (old name marked Obsolete)
- Rename `LineAndCol`, `SourcePos`, `SourcePosAndIndex`
    - Introduce derived class `LineAndColumn` as new name for `LineAndCol`
    - Introduce derived class `LineColumnFile` as new name for `SourcePos`
    - Introduce derived class `LineColumnFileAndIndex` as new name for `SourcePosAndIndex`
- `ISourceRange.Start` and `ISourceRange.End` became extension methods instead of properties, due to limitations of standard C# + 4.5 Framework (on Core I would've used default-implemented properties)
- `LNodeFactory.Literal(null)` now produces a compiler (ambigity) error; use `LNodeFactory.Null` instead
- `IParsingService` now accepts `IParsingOptions` instead of `ParsingMode mode = null, bool preserveComments = true` arguments. Extension methods have been added to replace the old methods, so existing users should recompile successfully, but if there are any external implementations, they will break.

#### Changes to LES3 (beta):

- Arbitrary acyclic graphs are supported by the parser ([#75](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/75)). There is still no support in the printer.
    - `@@double-at-literals` have been removed since `@@` now means "backreference". `@@inf.d` is now `_d"inf"`, `@@nan.f` is now `_f"nan"`, etc.
- Custom numeric literals in LES3 now implicitly add an underscore to the beginning of their type marker ([#76](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/76))
- Allow keyword-expressions begin with a comma-separated list of expressions ([#85](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/85))
- Add support for line continuator `|` (parser only) ([#86](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/86))
- Raised precedence of `**` above prefix operators, to match Python ([#87](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/87))
- Add support for prefix and suffix unary operators marked with apostrophes ([#106](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/106))
- Add support for backquote suffix operators (shorthand for binary IS operator) ([#106](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/106))
    - Consequently, `` 123`foo` `` is no longer a valid number format
- Eliminated keyword tokens so that `a .b!T` can parse ([#108](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/108))
- Rearrange lexer to allow `true`, `false` and `null` as type markers, which makes it slightly simpler
- Bug fix: for proper round-tripping, `%appendStatement` attribute should not cause a statement to be appended if the printer was given the `PrintTriviaExplicitly` flag
- Move `Les3PrinterOptions` and `TokenTree` to separate files.
- Tweak grammar of `MLComment` so that an unclosed multiline comment cannot be treated as an operator.

#### Changes to LES2 precedence table, matching changes in LES3:

- Raised precedence of `**` above prefix operators, to match Python ([#87](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/87))
- Raised precedence of `..` above multiplication operator, to match C# ([#87](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/87))
- A backquoted unary operator whose name start with an apostrophe will pick up the same precedence that it has in LES3.

#### Other changes:

Loyc.Interfaces:
- Add `ISerializedLiteral` to represent a serialized text form of a literal value (`TextValue` and `TypeMarker` properties)
- Add `ILiteralValue` which adds an `object Value` property to `ISerializedLiteral`
- `ILNode` (and `LNode`) now includes `ILiteralValue` (`TextValue` and `TypeMarker` properties)
- `IEither<L,R>`: added two `Maybe.Or` extension methods and two `Maybe.Then` extension methods
- `Either<L,R>`: added `Or(T defaultValue)` method
- Add `UString.IsNull` property
- Rename `LCExt` in `Loyc.Interfaces` to `CollectionSource` to avoid causing ambiguity errors when referring to `LCExt`, which also exists in `Loyc.Essentials`
- Optimize conversion from `UString` to `Symbol`
- Add `EmptySourceFile.Synthetic` and mark `EmptySourceFile.Default` as Obsolete.

Loyc.Essentials:
- `DictionaryExt`: added `GetOrAdd` and `AddOrUpdate` extension methods for `IDictionary<,>` that behave like the synonymous methods in `ConcurrentDictionary`
- `LinqToLists`: Add `ConcatNow()` methods
- `StringExt.FormatCore`: a recent change to `Localize` broke this method in the case that it is used as the `Localize.Formatter` and you call something like `"Hello {name}".Localize("name", "Joe")`. The problem is that for the sake of its own simplicity, `Localize` rounds up the number of arguments to 3 so that `FormatCore` always receives at least 3 arguments. `FormatCore` was programmed to assume the last N arguments are name-value pairs for some even number N. If you wrote `"{0} {name}".Localize(1, 2, "name", "Joe")`, for example, since there is a numeric argument {0} and 4 arguments total, it would assume the named arguments start at index 2. This round-up behavior has been removed. Instead, now it is simply assumes that the first named argument appears after all the numeric
  ones; if the number of remaining arguments is odd then the last argument is simply ignored.

Loyc.Collections:
- Cancel obsolescence of `BDictionary.AddIfNotPresent` since it actually provides more functionality than the `GetOrAdd` extension method (i.e. its boolean result)
- `Bijection<,>`: implement `IDictionaryImpl` instead of `IDictionaryAndReadOnly` , thus including `IDictionarySink`
- Cancel obsolescence of `BDictionary.AddIfNotPresent` since it actually provides more functionality than the `GetOrAdd` extension method (i.e. its boolean result)
- In `BDictionary` and `DictionaryExt` (`IDictionary` extension method): renamed `SetAndGet` to `GetAndSet` to help convey a sense that it gets the old value before overwriting it.
- Implement `ITryGet<K, V>` in a few collections (sometimes implicitly via `IListSource<T>` or `IDictionaryEx<K,V>`)
- Also implement `IIndexed<K,V>` on several collections (this required no new methods, since collections already have indexers)
- Methods of the form `TryGet(K k, ref V v)` are now deprecated ([Obsolete])
- Remove a few implementations of `TryGet` that are no longer needed (or weren't really needed in the first place)

Loyc.Syntax:
- Various APIs now generally refer to `LNodeList` instead of `VList<LNode>` and `matchCode` macro now emits references to `LNodeList` instead of `VList<LNode>`.
- `SourceRange.ToString` now prints line/column numbers, to improve the default way that message sinks print locations in source code.
- LES3 parser now records the fact that literals are hex or binary ([#46](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/))
- Add `ILiteralValueProvider` and public implementations `LiteralValue` and `ParsedValue`. There is also an internal implementation `SimpleValue<V>` which is used for simple literals that are instantiated with a value V and no source text.
- Added new overloads of `LNode.Literal(...)`
- Add `IParsingOptions`, `ParsingOptions`
- **Note:** `CustomLiteral` will be deprecated soon. `LNode` itself now includes `TypeMarker` and `TextValue` properties which eliminate the need for it. Use the new overloads of `LNode.Literal()` that accept `ILiteralValueProvider` or `LiteralValue` to produce nodes that provide values in the new properties.

### v2.7.2: April 4, 2020 ###

- Add `IMaybe<T>` and tweak the new `IEither<L,R>` interface to use it, so that generic variance works with the interface.
- Added static `Either<ToL,ToR>.From(Either<L,T>)` method for achieving variance without using the interface. Also added `Select()` for more complicated conversions.
- Tweaked return type of `ArraySlice<T>.GetEnumerator` for likely higher efficiency
- Tweaked type of `EmptyEnumerator<T>.Empty` to be `IEnumerator<T>` to help C# choose the correct type when it is used with the `? :` operator.
- Fix potential overflow in `Statistic.Variance()`

### v2.7.1.4: March 29, 2020 ###

- Belatedly added `Either<L,R>`, a struct that holds "one" of two types (really both, with a boolean indicating which one.) Should've added this years ago. The `Left` and `Right` properties return a `Maybe<L>` and `Maybe<R>` respectively, and there's a `Value` property that returns either `Left.Value` or `Right.Value` as appropriate. Also added interface `IEither<L,R>`.
- Add `ROLSlice<TList,T>` for slicing `IReadOnlyList<T>` types. This is an improvement over Slice_<T> which can't slice BCL lists.
- Add `ILineAndColumn`, `ILineColumnFile`, and `ISourceRange` which will be used in breaking changes in v2.8.0. Specifically, the `IIndexToLine`, `IIndexPositionMapper`, `ISourceFile` and `ILNode` interfaces will returns these interfaces instead of the concrete types `LineAndCol`, `SourcePos`, and `SourceRange`.
- Renamed `AbstractTriviaInjector.AttachTriviaTo` to `GetAttachedTrivia`. Technically it's a breaking change, but in a location obscure enough that probably no one is affected.

### v2.7.0.4: March 10, 2020 (re-release of 2.7.0.3) ###

There are a bunch of breaking changes here, most notably the fact that you need to add a reference to Loyc.Interfaces.dll. This is also a transitionary release: more breaking changes will occur in v2.8.0.0 (semantic version 28.0.0), and it's probably wise to upgrade just one semantic version at a time.

Apologies: the new Loyc.Interfaces package was broken in NuGet in v2.7.0.3

#### Regularization of collection interfaces

Several changes were made to the collection interfaces to make the set more complete, consistent and useful.

Each of the three common types of collection (collection, list, dictionary) now has 3-4 interfaces:

1. "AndReadOnly" interfaces (`IListAndReadOnly<T>`, `ICollectionAndReadOnly<T>`, `IDictionaryAndReadOnly<K,V>`) are to be implemented by read-only sequences that want to implement the writable interface (`IList<T>`, `IDictionary<K,V>`) for compatibility reasons.
2. "AndSource" interfaces (`ICollectionAndSource<T>`, `IListAndListSource<T>`) implement "AndReadOnly" (e.g. `IListAndListSource<T>` implements `IListAndReadOnly<T>`) but include an enhanced Loyc interface (`IListSource<T>` is the enhanced version of `IReadOnlyList<T>` and `ICollectionSource<T>` is the enhanced version of `IReadOnlyCollection<T>`).
3. An "Impl" interface (`IListImpl<T>`, `ICollectionImpl<T>`, `IDictionaryImpl<K, V>`) is the main interface that editable Loyc collection types should implement.
4. Extended interfaces (`ICollectionEx<T>`, `IListEx<T>`, `IDictionaryEx<T>`) are variations that add extra functionality to allow sophisticated collection types to offer higher performance for some operations.

Categories 1-3 exist mainly for the purpose of disambiguation and you should generally NOT create variables of these types, as explained in the [documentation of `IListImpl<T>`](http://ecsharp.net/doc/code/interfaceLoyc_1_1Collections_1_1IListImpl.html).

#### Loyc.Interfaces.dll

Added Loyc.Interfaces.dll (available on NuGet) to hold (almost) all interfaces defined in Loyc.Essentials.dll, Loyc.Syntax.dll, etc. Aside from interfaces, enums, and delegates, it also contains a small number of essential structs and classes, most notably `Symbol`, `UString`, `Maybe<T>`, and `Localize`. These are types that the interfaces refer to, or that the concrete types themselves depend on. This new library allows you to use Loyc interfaces without taking a dependency on the heavier Loyc.Essentials library. However, this initial release is heavier than I would like at 84KB, as it includes some concrete types that I would rather not include (they are included because `Symbol`, `UString`, `Maybe<T>`, and/or `Localize` depend on them, directly or indirectly). Some of these types will be moved back to Loyc.Essentials in a future version.

- Marked `IAddRange` and `IListRangeMethods` as `<in T>`.
- Added `ICollectionSource<T>` and added it as a base of `ISetImm`
- Added `ICollectionAndReadOnly<T>`, `IListAndReadOnly<T>`, `IDictionaryAndReadOnly<T>`
- Added `ICollectionAndSource<T>`
- Added `IDictionaryEx` interface
- Added `IOptimize` as common subinterface of `IAutoSizeArray<T>` and `INegAutoSizeArray<T>`
- `IListAndListSource<T>` now includes `ICollectionSource<T>` (which has `CopyTo` and `Contains` methods.)

#### Loyc.Essentials

Changes that are most likely to be breaking:

- Rename `BaseDictionary` to `DictionaryBase` for consistency.
- Eliminated `StringSlice` (`UString` now implements its interface, `IRange<char>`)
- A new namespace [`Loyc.Collections.MutableListExtensionMethods`](http://ecsharp.net/doc/code/namespaceLoyc_1_1Collections_1_1MutableListExtensionMethods.html) has been added specifically to contain extension methods for `ICollection<T>` and `IList<T>` that are possibly ambiguous when included in the same namespace as extension methods for `IReadOnlyCollection<T>` and `IReadOnlyList<T>`. This is needed due to a design flaw in .NET and C#. [Issue #84](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/84) describes the problem in more detail. Most of the extension methods in this namespace are likely to be deprecated soon.

Other changes:

- Removed `ICollectionEx<T>.RemoveAll` which works well enough as an extension method (none of the existing collection types accelerate it, though AList could theoretically do so)
- Added extension methods for `IDictionary` and `IDictionaryEx`: `GetAndRemove`, `AddRange` with `DictEditMode` parameter
- Added `SetExt` extension methods for `ISet<K>`
- Added `IDictionarySink` and `IDictionaryAndReadOnly`.
- Added extension method `AddIfNotPresent` for `IList<T>`
- Added extension method `AsReadOnlyDictionary`  with `SelectDictionaryFromKeys` adapter
- Added extension methods for `IDictionary<K,V>`: `TryGetValue(K key)`, `AddRange`, `SetRange`, `RemoveRange`
- Added more `LinqToLists.Select` extension methods for `ICollection`/`IReadOnlyCollection`, with corresponding adapters `SelectCollection` and `SelectReadOnlyCollection`.
- Edit `BDictionary` and `MMap` to support `IDictionaryEx`.
- Edit `InvertibleSet` to support new `CopyTo` method.
- Added `ByteArrayInString` class, which encodes and decodes BAIS (Byte Array In String) encoding. BAIS preserves runs of ASCII characters unchanged. It is useful for debugging (since ASCII runs are visible) and for conversion of bytes to JSON.
- Added `G.DecodeBase64Digit`, `G.EncodeBase64Digit`.
- Added overloads of `TryPopFirst` and `TryPopLast` in `UString` and `RangeExt`.

#### Loyc.Collections:

- `BMultiMap` now accepts `null` values for the key and value comparator. A null key comparer means "use the default key comparer", while a null value comparer means "pretend all values are equal". If you use the `(null, null)` constructor, you should avoid calling `this[key].Remove(value)` or `this[key].Contains(value)`, since these methods will treat _any_ value as a match.

#### Loyc.Syntax:

- Replaced `#trivia_` prefix with `%` ([issue #61](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/61))
- LES2 and LES3 precedence tables have changed ([issue #87](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/87))
- LES3: Support `:` as prefix operator (not supporting it earlier was accidental)
- LES3: Add `initially` (alongside `finally`) as a continuator
- Added `LNode.FlattenBinaryOpSeq()` 
- Added `CodeSymbols.Matches` (`'=~` operator)
- Rename `#usingCast` to `'using` (`CodeSymbols.UsingCast`)
- Rename `#namedArg` to `'::=` (alternate name: `<:`) (the name `CodeSymbols.NamedArg` is unchanged)
- Rename `#of` to `'of` (`CodeSymbols.Of`) ([issue #96](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/96))
- Rename `#tuple` to `'tuple` (`CodeSymbols.Tuple`) ([issue #96](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/96))
- Rename `#is/#as/#cast` to `'is/'as/'cast`  (`CodeSymbols.Is/As/Cast`) ([issue #96](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/96))
- Rename `#default` to `'default`  (`CodeSymbols.Default`) even for the label form, `default:` ([issue #96](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/96))
- Rename `#sizeof/#typeof` to `'sizeof/'typeof` (`CodeSymbols.Sizeof/Typeof`)
- Rename suffix operators (`x[], x++, x--`) to have a consistent prefix of `'suf` ([issue #96](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/96))
- Rename `CodeSymbols.Neqâ†’NotEq`, `NodeStyle.Statementâ†’StatementBlock`
- Split `#new` into `'new` operator and `#new` attribute (`CodeSymbols.New` and `CodeSymbols.NewAttribute`)
- Split `#switch` into `'switch` operator and `#switch` statement. `CodeSymbols.Switch` was split into `CodeSymbols.SwitchStmt` and `CodeSymbols.SwitchExpr`. Note: EC# parser does not yet support the switch expression.
- Increase block size in `BaseLexer`, mainly to reduce branch mispredictions
- Deleted `IToLNode`. `ILNode.ToLNode` is now an extension method only, not a core part of the interface.

### v2.6.9: January 21, 2020 ###

Loyc.Essentials:

- Enable compiler optimizations (oops)

Loyc.Collections:

- ALists:
  - Added `CountSizeInBytes()` methods in all variants of AList (see also `ListBenchmarks.CountSizeInBytes` methods implemented for `List<T>, Dictionary<K,V>, SortedDictionary<K,V>`, and `LinkedList<T>`)
  - Added convenience method `SparseAList<T>.AddSpace(count)`
  - `AList` and `SparseAList`: Change how node splitting works for better bulk-add performance. Specifically, when splitting to add an item to the end of a node, the new left node will be 100% full and the right node will contain only one item, so that repeated calls to Add will naturally build a sequence of full nodes.
  - Optimize AList insertions by redistributing adjacent children in bulk
  - Optimize `AList.AddRange`
  - Optimize `AList<T>.this[index]` for small lists
  - Switch internal list from `InternalDList` to `InternalList` (`InternalDList` may have slightly faster insert/remove, but other operations are faster, most importantly `this[int]`.)
  - Default inner node size is now 64 to match leaf size
  - Node classes: Add debug/test properties `Children` and `Leaves`
  - Hide unimportant properties in debugger
- Optimize enumerators of InternalList, InternalDList and AList
  - InternalList: `yield return` measured to be slow. Avoided it.
  - DList/AList: Factor out "rare" parts to encourage inlining.

Loyc.Utilities:

- Add `AListSumTracker` and `AListStatisticTracker` classes with extension methods on `AListBase<K,T>`

### v2.6.8: May 12, 2019 ###

- Introduced .NET Standard 2.0 versions. NuGet package now contains four builds: .NET 3.5, .NET 4.0, .NET 4.5 and .NET Standard 2.

### v2.6.7: March 17, 2019 ###

- LES: Make `* /` and `<< >>` miscible. Precedence of `<< >>` is between `+ -` and `* /` so `x << 1 - 1` means `(x << 1) - 1`.
- LES: Keep `& | ^` immiscible with `== != > <`, but give them higher precedence than comparison operators in LES3 only.

### v2.6.6: March 16, 2019 ###

- Loyc.Syntax issue #61: `%` is now recognized as a trivia marker by `CodeSymbols.IsTriviaSymbol`, `LNode.IsTrivia`, `LNodeExt.IsTrivia`.
- LES: Add triangle operators `|> <|`
- LES bug fix: fix precedence of `..<` to match `..`
- LES3: Allow nonparenthesized attributes to have an argument list (e.g. `@attr(args) expr`)

### v2.6.5: February 17, 2019 ###

Loyc.Syntax:

- Design fix: Change `ILNode.Target` to have a more appropriate return type.
- Added convenience method for printing `ILNode` in `Les2LanguageService` and `Les3LanguageService`

### v2.6.4: September 18, 2018 ###

- Loyc.Collections: Add support for priority queues: `MinHeap`, `MaxHeap`, `MinHeapInList`, `MaxHeapInList`.

### v2.6.3: July 23, 2018 ###

Loyc.Syntax:

- Edit the default token-to-string method `TokenExt.ToString()` so it works more sensibly on non-LES tokens that are still based on `TokenKind`.
- Swap int value of `TokenKind.Spaces` with `TokenKind.Other` so that lexers oblivious to `TokenKind` will typically have integer values in the `TokenKind.Other` region.
- `Token.ToSourceRange` and `Token.Range` were duplicate methods; removed the first.

### v2.6.2: October 1, 2017 ###

- LESv3: Tweaked the precedence of `->` and `<-`. These operators can now be mixed with logical and bitwise operators (`|`, `&&`, `|`, `^` , `&`, `==`, `>`, etc.) and are right-associative.
- v2.6.2.1: Bug fix in `SparseAList.NextHigherItem`, `NextLowerItem` when `index` is negative or `int.MaxValue`.

### v2.6.1: September 28, 2017 ###

#### LES

- Made several changes to LESv3 and LESv2 as discussed in [issue #52](https://github.com/qwertie/ecsharp/issues/52):
  - v3: Added token lists like `'(+ x 1)` to allow custom syntax (comparable to s-expressions)
  - v3: `.dotKeywords` will be stored as `#hashKeywords`
  - v3: `#` is officially an ID character (but was already treated as such)
  - v3: `.keyw0rds` can now contain digits
  - v3: Hexadecimal and binary floating-point numbers no longer require a `p0` suffix
  - v2/v3: The precedence of non-predefined operators will now be based on the last punctuation character, rather than the first punctuation character. If applicable, the first and last punctuation character still determines the precedence (e.g. `>%>` will still have the same precedence as `>>`)
  - v3: The precedence of `::` has been raised to match `.`
  - v3: `x*.2` will now be parsed as `x * .2` rather than `x *. 2`, but `0..2` will still be parsed as `0 .. 2`.
  - v2/v3: The precedence of arrow operators like `->` has been lowered. The parser treats their precedence sa above `&&` but below `| ^`
  - v3: Modified the set of continuators.

### v2.6.0: August 30, 2017 ###

#### Loyc.Essentials

- Added `G.True(T)`, `G.True(Action)`, `G.Swap(ref dynamic, ref dynamic)`

#### Loyc.Syntax

- LESv2/v3: Operator `..` now has precedence above `+- * /`.
- LESv2/v3: Change `!!` from an infix to a suffix operator based on Kotlin's `!!` operator. Add `!.` operator with precedence of `.`.
- LESv3: Negative numbers are now written `n"-123"` instead of `-123`, (see [blog post](http://loyc.net/2017/negation-blues.html)). Lexer tentatively accepts âˆ’123 (en dash).
- LESv3: Enable printer to print `- -a` and `a. -b` instead of `-`'-`(a)` and `a.(@@ -b)`.
- Changed symbols `#[]`, `#[,]`, `#in` to `'[]`, `'[,]`, `'in` for consistency with other operators.

### v2.5.1: January 19, 2017 ###

#### Loyc.Syntax

- Bug fix: `ParsingService.ParseFile` could cause `IOException` that says "Cannot access a closed file"
- `BaseLexer`/`BaseParser`: Renamed the `Error` method that is called by `Match`/`MatchExcept` to `MatchError` and added an anti-infinite-loop mechanism.

### v2.5.0: January 13, 2017 ###

#### Loyc.Essentials

- Renamed `ISinkCollection` => `ICollectionSink`, `ISinkArray` => `IArraySink`, `ISinkList` => `IListSink` for consistency with `IMessageSink` and `IListSource`

#### Localization

- Added `Localize.UseResourceManager()`
- Methods of `Localize` that accept a symbol representing the string to translate were renamed from `Localized` to `Symbol`.
- Introduced "auto-fallback" behavior in `ThreadLocalVariable`. `Localize.Localizer` and `Formatter` use it to mitigate .NET's lack of thread-local propagation.

#### Message sinks (logging)

- `MessageSink`: Added extension methods `Error`, `Warn`, `Debug`, etc. Added customizable `ContextToString` delegate to replace `LocationString`. Added `WithContext`.
- Removed setter of `MessageSink.Default` (use `SetDefault` instead)
- Wrappers `SeverityMessageFilter` and `MessageSplitter` now have an optional `TContext` type parameter.
- `ConsoleMessageSink`, `TraceMessageSink` and `NullMessageSink` have singleton `Value` properties now.
- Added `MessageSinkWithContext<TContext>` wrapper for `IMessageSink`.
- Changed argument order of `TraceMessageSink` for consistency with other classes
- Removed `Severity.Detail`, replacing it with a separate `Detail` version of each member of `Severity`.
- Added `includeDetails` parameter to constructor of `SeverityMessageFilter` in the hope of drawing attention to the possibility of accidentally excluding details, while making some older code behave correctly at the same time.
- Renamed `MessageSplitter` to `MessageMulticaster`. Renamed some method parameters.

### v2.4.2: January 8, 2017 ###

- Rename `LinqToCollections` to `LinqToLists`.
- Rename some rarely used members of `Severity` to form a group of "frequency signals": `Common`, `Uncommon`, `Rare`.
- Add extension methods for `IServiceProvider`/`IServiceContainer` (`System.ComponentModel.Design`) in static class `Loyc.ServiceProvider`.

#### LESv3 (prerelease) changed:

- Eliminated block-call expressions
- Eliminated single-quoted operators
- Keywords now have a separate token type
- Syntax of keyword expressions changed. Initial expr now optional; newline allowed before braces/continuators; any expression is allowed after a continuator.
- Parser: introduced token lists (`VList<LNode>`) and eliminated token tree literals (`TokenTree`)
- Parser: edited to reduce output size
- Parser: tweaked error handling
- Parser: `@@` now acts like an attribute instead of only being allowed after `(`
- Parser now requires a space after word operators and "combo" operators

### v2.4.0.1: December 26, 2016 ###

- Changed LES generic syntax so that `a.b!c` is parsed as `a.(b!c)` instead of `(a.b)!c`.

### v2.3.3: December 21, 2016 ###

- LESv3: added syntax `(@@ expr)` to group an expression without adding `#trivia_inParens`
- LESv3 parser now requires whitespace after an attribute.
- Bug fix: LES2 and LES3 printers now print ``@`'.`(a, -b)`` correctly.
- Bug fix in `LNodeExt.MatchesPattern`: `Foo(...)` did not match pattern `$x(...)`
- Renamed `IReferenceComparable` to `IReferenceEquatable`
- Moved `Reverse()` extension method to `LinqToCollections`.

### v2.3.2: December 12, 2016 ###

- Changed return type of `MessageSink.SetDefault` as intended to be done earlier.
- Rename `MathF8`, `MathF16`, etc. to `MathFPI8`, `MathFPI16`, etc.

### v2.3.1: December 11, 2016 ###

Loyc.Essentials was split into Loyc.Essentials and Loyc.Math. Loyc.Math contains

- Most of the math stuff, including `Math128`, `MathEx`, the fixed point types (`FPI8`, `FPI16`, etc.), `Maths<T>`, and the math helper structs (`MathI`, `MathD`, etc.)
- Most of the geometry stuff, including `BoundingBox<T>`, `LineSegment`, `Point<T>`, and `Vector<T>`
- `NumRange<Num,Math>`

However, Loyc.Essentials retains most of the math interface definitions.

Loyc.Syntax and Loyc.Collections reference Loyc.Essentials but not Loyc.Math.

Some static classes were split between Loyc.Essentials & Loyc.Math:

- `Range` was split. The class `Range` went to Loyc.Math and contains methods that return `NumRange`. The `IsInRange` and `PutInRange` methods went class `G` in `Loyc.Essentials`
- `MathEx` was split. Most methods remained in `MathEx` which went to Loyc.Math. The methods `Swap` and `SortPair` went to class `G`. While `CountOnes`, `Log2Floor`, `ShiftLeft` and `ShiftRight` are still in `MathEx`, certain overloads are implemented in `G` or duplicated in `G` because they are needed by Loyc.Collections and Loyc.Syntax.

Other changes:

- The rarely-used `CPTrie` types and `KeylessHashtable` were moved from Loyc.Collections to Loyc.Utilities
- Some geometry stuff was moved from Loyc.Utilities to Loyc.Math.
- The `ParseHelpers` class was split between Loyc.Essentials and Loyc.Syntax, with the conversion-to-string stuff going to `PrintHelpers` in Loyc.Essentials and the conversion-from-string stuff going to `ParseHelpers` in Loyc.Syntax.
- Certain classes like Localize were changed to follow the Ambient Service Pattern more closely.

### v2.2.0: December 7, 2016 ###

- Tweaked Ambient Service Pattern
    
    - Renamed `MessageSink.Current` to `MessageSink.Default`
    - Introduced `IHasMutableValue<T>`
    - Renamed `PushedTLV<T>` to `SavedValue<T>`, now operates on `IHasMutableValue<T>`
    - Removed `G.PushTLV()`

### v2.1.0: December 3, 2016 ###

- Eliminated `LNodePrinter` delegate, replacing it with `ILNodePrinter`. `LNodePrinter` now holds standard extension methods of `ILNodePrinter`.
- `IParsingService` no longer includes a printing capability; language services implement `ILNodePrinter` separately.
- Renamed `LesNodePrinter` to `Les2Printer`, `LesParser` to `Les2Parser`, and so on for `LesLexer` and LESv2 unit tests.
- `LinqToCollections`: Added `TakeWhile()` and `SkipWhile()` extension methods for  IList`, `IListSource`, `INegListSource`.
- Added extension method `INegListSource<T>.TryGet(index)`
- Added one-param constructor to `MacroProcessor` and switched order of params to other constructor for harmony.

### v2.0.0: November 23, 2016 ###

- `IParsingService.Print` has changed as follows:
    - Old: `string Print(LNode node, IMessageSink msgs, object mode, string indentString, string lineSeparator);`
    - New: `string Print(LNode node, IMessageSink msgs, ParsingMode mode, ILNodePrinterOptions options);`
- Introduced `ILNodePrinterOptions` interface and `LNodePrinterOptions` class. This interface is shared among all languages; each language also has its own options type with extra options. The options object eliminates the need for users to create printer objects, so the constructors of the LES/EC# printers have gone internal.
- We now avoid using `SourcePos` for the context of `IMessageSink.Write()`; `SourceRange` is now used instead.
- `IParsingService.Parse` now preserves comments by default, if possible.
- `LNode.Equals` now has a `CompareMode` parameter which can be set to ignore trivia.
- Bug fix: `InParens()` no longer creates trivia with a range covering the entire node (it confuses the trivia injector)
- Bug fix: `IndexPositionMapper` unit tests were not set up to run, and it was broken
- Eliminated `NodeStyle.Alternate2`; added `NodeStyle.InjectedTrivia` which is applied to trivia attributes by `AbstractTriviaInjector`.
- `LesNodePrinter` now includes context when an unprintable literal is encountered.
- Introduce generic base interfaces of `IMessageSink`.

### v1.9.6: November 23, 2016 ###

- Eliminated rarely-used optional arguments of some `LNode` creation methods.
- `LinqToCollections`: Added `Select(this IList<T>, ...)` and `FirstOrDefault(this IList<T>, T)`.
- Bug fix in `LNodeFactory` that messed up trivia injector for EC#

### v1.9.5: November 14, 2016 ###

- LESv2 and LESv3 can now preserve comments and newlines and round-trip them to their printers.
- Added a few extension methods, most notably `StringBuilderExt`.
- Introduced `ILNode` interface for objects that want to pretend to be Loyc trees. Added `LNode.Equals(ILNode, ILNode)`.
- LES printers can now print `ILNode` objects directly, but most other functionality still requires `LNode` and this is not planned to change.
- Changed the way trivia works (new `#trivia_trailing` attribute) and improved the way the LES2 printer prints trivia
- Tweaked the way the trivia injector talks to its derived class.
- `IParsingService`: Added overload `Print(IEnumerable<LNode>, ...)`.
- `LNodeFactory`: Added `TriviaNewline`, `OnNewLine()`
- `LNodeExt`: Added `GetTrivia()`
- `EscapeC` & `EscapeCStyle`: Changed `EscapeC.Default`; added `UnicodeNonCharacters` and `UnicodePrivateUse` options. Single quotes are no longer escaped by default but non-characters and private characters are.
- Eliminated `SelectNegLists` and `SelectNegListSources`, which most likely no one was using. Renamed `NegView` to `AsNegList` for consistency with `AsList` etc. Added methods to `LinqToCollections` for `INegListSource`.
- Renamed `Front` to `First` and `Back` to `Last` in the `Range` interfaces.
- Changed API of `Les3PrettyPrinter`
- Updated LESv3 printer to support most of the recent changes to LESv3. Semicolons are no longer printed by default.
- LESv3 now allows `\\` to end single-line comments, to make it easier for the printer to avoid newlines in illegal places.

### v1.9.4: October 25, 2016 ###

- `IParsingService`: added `CanPreserveComments` property and comment preservation flag when parsing
- Improved trivia injector (`AbstractTriviaInjector`); added `NodeStyle.OneLiner`
- Added `UString.EndsWith()`

### v1.9.3: October 12, 2016 ###

- Fixed a race condition in `SymbolPool.Get` (issue #43)
- Added helper classes for preserving comments (`TriviaSaver`, `AbstractTriviaInjector`, `StandardTriviaInjector`)
- Changed syntax of LESv3, partly in response to the [survey results](https://goo.gl/forms/XYRV1NrxfOB4IHNu1): Newline is now a terminator; added `.keywords`; removed juxtaposition operator; added new kinds of infix operator based on identifiers (e.g. `x s> y`, `a if c else b`); colon is allowed as a final suffix on any expression. (printer not yet updated)

### v1.9.2: September 3, 2016 ###

- Introduced LESv3 parser, printer, unit tests and parsing service (`Les3LanguageService`), plus a pretty-printer (`Les3PrettyPrinter`) with colored HTML and console output.
- Add `BigInteger` literals to LESv2 and LESv3 (Issue #42) via `z` suffix
- Tweaked LESv2 and LESv3 precedence rules. Most code will be unaffected; as LES has few users, it seems better not to fork `LesPrecedence` and `LesPrecedenceMap` for v3.
- `LNode`: changed definition of `HasSpecialName` due to LESv3 idea to use '.' to mark keyword-expressions.
- `LNode:` added `PlusAttrBefore()`, `PlusAttrsBefore()`
- `NodeStyle.DataType` is unused, so changed name to `Reserved` (for future use)
- `ParseHelpers`: `EscapeCStyle`/`UnescapeCStyle`: added support for 5-digit and 6-digit unicode code points and changed APIs to be `UString`-centric.
- Added `StringExt.AppendCodePoint`, `UString.Left`, `UString.Right`. Allow `UString -> Symbol` conversion. Fixed bugs in `StringExt.EliminateNamedArgs`. Eliminated bitwise-not-on-error behavior when `UString` decodes a code point, because the behavior wasn't wanted in LES parser.
- Add `ParseHelpers.IntegerToString` and `ParseNumberFlag.SkipSingleQuotes`
- Tweaked `NodeStyle` to have named values for common literal styles (hex, triple-quoted, etc.)
- Bug fix in `MiniTest`: failure was ignored by overloads that took a string message

### v1.9.0: July 26, 2016 ###

- Names of operators in LES and EC# now start with an apostrophe (`'`)
- Also, `suf` in operator names changed from being a prefix to a suffix
- Renamed `CodeSymbols.*Set` to `CodeSymbols.*Assign`
- Removed 'Python mode' from LES; tweaked the lexer

### v1.8.1: June 13, 2016 ###

- Bug fix in LES printer: `/*suffix comments*/` were printed incorrectly (with no content).

Minor changes:

- Loyc.Essentials: Changed illogical return value of `LCInterfaces.IndexOf()` to be nullable.
- Deleted `G.Assert` in favor of `Contract.Assert()` compatibility method in .NET 3.5 builds
- Bug fix: `IndentTokenGenerator` (and LES parser) crashed in case of empty input
- Bug fix in `LNode`: implemented `IReadOnlyCollection.Count`

### v1.7.6: 2016 ###

- Add extension methods for `LNode`: `Without`, `WithoutAttr`

### v1.7.5: April 29, 2016 ###

- VLists: added `SmartSelectMany`; replaced dedicated `WhereSelect` with one based on `Transform`; deleted `Select<Out>`; renamed `Where` to `SmartWhere`. Replaced a few `Predicate<T>` with `Func<T, bool>` for consistency with LINQ-to-Objects

### v1.7.4: April 18, 2016 ###

- `IParsingService`: changed `inputType` parameters to use `ParsingMode`, a new extensible enumeration. Added additional modes.
- Helper methods for parsing and printing tokens and hex digits have been moved from `Loyc.G` to `Loyc.Syntax.ParseHelpers`
- Renamed `USlice(this string...)` to `Slice`
- Removed `G.Pair` which was a duplicate of `Pair.Create`

### v1.7.3: April 18, 2016 ###

- Bug fix in MiniTest: some assert methods ignored user-defined message
- Bug fix in `LastIndexWhere()` extension method

### v1.7.2: April 1, 2016 ###

- Extension methods: added `Slice(this NumRange)`, and non-allocating overloads of `IsOneOf()`
- `LNode`: Added new `ReplaceRecursive` overload that can delete items.
- `LNode` perf: All call nodes now cache their hashcode.

### v1.6.0: Mar 9, 2016 ###

- Renamed `Range.Single` => `ListExt.Single`, `MathEx.InRange` => `Range.PutInRange`, `In.*` => `Range.*`, `Range.Excl` => `Range.ExcludeHi`, `Range.Incl` => `Range.Inclusive`

### v1.5.1: Mar 5, 2016 ###

- Removed `IntRange`; replaced by `NumRange<N,M>` to support the EC# `lo..hi` and `lo...hi` operators; added `Floor` and `Ceiling` to Maths types as needed by `NumRange`.

### v1.5.0: Mar 2, 2016 ###

- Renamed `RVList` to `VList`, and renamed `RWList` to `WList`.
- `LNodeFactory`: Renamed `F._Missing` to `F.Missing` (and the less-oft-used `LNodeFactory.Missing` to Missing_ to avoid a name collision).
- `LNode`: Added overloads: of `LNode.Calls(string)`, `LNode.IsIdNamed(string)`, `LNode.List(IEnumerable<LNode>)`. 
- `LNodeExt`: Added `WithoutNodeNamed` extension method.
- Renamed `LineAndPos` to `LineAndCol`

### v1.4.1: Feb 28, 2016 ###

- (jonathan.vdc) LES: Added named float literals for infinity and NaN.

### v1.4.0: Aug 25, 2015 ###

- Renamed `MessageHolder.Message` to `LogMessage` (top-level class); introduced a wrapper exception `LogException`.

### July updates: forgot to raise version number ###

- LESv2: working and mostly tested! All LES-based parsers, lexers and unit tests throughout the codebase have been updated to use the new syntax. JSON compatibility was also added.
- Combined `TokenKind.Number`, `TokenKind.String`, `TokenKind.OtherLit` into a single thing, `TokenKind.Literal`, and removed all distinctions between literals from the parsers for LES, EC# and LLLPG.
- Split the symbol for indexing and array types into two separate symbols `_[]` (IndexBracks) and `[]` (Array), where previously `[]` (Bracks) was used for both.
- Bug fix: updated `LNodeFactory`, `StdSimpleCallNode`, `StdSimpleCallNodeWithAttrs` to support custom source range for `Target`.
- LES: Parser rewritten into a completely whitespace-agnostic version with a "juxtaposition operator" instead of superexpressions. However, I don't think I'll keep this version, it's too limiting.
- LES: Removed `TokensToTree` from lexer pipeline.
- LES: Language made simpler by removing all operators containing backslash.

### v1.3.2: Jun 21, 2015 ###

- Refactored LES parser to use the new `BaseParserForList` as its base class. Added property `BaseParser.ErrorSink` to match `BaseLexer` (to eliminate the need for `ParserSourceWorkaround`)
- Moved all unit tests from LoycCore assemblies to LoycCore.Tests.csproj (renamed from Tests.csproj).
  Savings: about 20K in Loyc.Essentials, 61K in Loyc.Collections, 55K in Loyc.Syntax, 25K in Loyc.Utilities.
- LES [(v1)](https://github.com/qwertie/LoycCore/wiki/LESv1): "Python mode" (ISM) installed and tested
- Added `IIndexToLine` as part of `ILexer<Token>` because certain lexers don't have a `SourceFile`, and `BaseLexer` implements `IndexToLine` anyway
- Implemented and tested `IndentTokenGenerator`
- Changed `IDeque` interface to use `Maybe<T>` and eliminated most of the extension methods
- `list.TryGet(i)` extension methods for lists now return `Maybe<T>.NoValue` instead of `default(T)` on fail
- Defined `IHasValue<T>`
- Moved the benchmarks to their own project, LoycCore.Benchmarks.
- Bug fix: `NullReferenceException` in `AListIndexer.VerifyCorrectness`

### v1.3.1: Jun 14, 2015 ###

- `ILocationString.LocationString` changed to `IHasLocation.Location`; now returns `object` for greater generality
- Some names changed in `Maybe<T>`. Added `Or()`, `AsMaybe()` & `AsNullable()`.
- `ILexer<Token>` now has a type parameter; `NextToken()` now returns `Maybe<Token>` instead of `Token?` so that `Token` is not required to be a struct.
- Added `BaseILexer<CharSrc,Token>`, and installed it as the new base class of `LesLexer`
- Added `BaseLexer.ErrorSink` property; default behavior is still to throw `FormatException`
- `LesLexer` no longer produces `Spaces` tokens.
- `LesNodePrinter` bug fix: /*comments*/ were printed twice, once as comments and once as attributes
- Bug fix in `ArraySlice.Slice(), ListSlice.Slice()`

### v1.3.0: May 27, 2015 ###

I'm not attempting to make release notes this far back, although the vast majority of code and features were written well before v1.0.
